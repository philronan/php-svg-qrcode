### Generate SVG QR Codes

This PHP library generates SVG QR codes that are a bit more appealing than conventional codes but can still be read easily. It's based on [code by psyon](https://github.com/psyon/php-qrcode), and is ultimately derived from [barcode.php by kreativekorp](https://github.com/kreativekorp/barcode).
